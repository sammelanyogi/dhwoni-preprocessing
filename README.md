# Dhwoni Preprocessing

## This is preprocessing section of dhwoni - a nepali speech recognition system

### Experiment 1

#### Feature extraction using Linear Predictive Coding (LPC)

![Linear Predictive Coding](lpc.png?raw=true "Linear Predictive Coding")

Proposed by Gunnar Fant in 1960. This technique considers glottis and vocal tract as fully uncoupled.

## Step by step MFCC feature extraction is done manually with procress graph.
